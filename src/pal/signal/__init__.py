signal - A collection of functions generally useful for psychoacoustics-based
signal processing.

Functions include:

atten - Attenuates input array by a dB value
compensate - Shapes the input array in the frequency domain [UNTESTED]
envelope - Extracts the amplitude envelope from a signal
equate - Equates wavefiles in rms
erbs2f - Converts erb numbers to frequency values
f2erbs - Converts frequency values to erb numbers
f2place - Converts a frequency (Hz) to a basilar membrane place (mm)
f2oct - Calculates the distance in octaves between two frequencies
fconv - Convolves two signals using FFT-based fast convolution
filterbank - Filters the input array with a bank of filters [UNTESTED]
f0 - Estimates the fundamental frequency of a signal
gammatone - Computes the filter coefficients for a bank of Gammatone filters [UNTESTED]
hcomplex - Generates harmonic complexes
interp_lin - Interpolates a signal using linear interpolation
interp_spline - Interpolates a signal using cubic spline interpolation
magspec - Computes the magnitude spectrum of a signal
mls - Generates maximum-length sequences
ms2samp - Converts milliseconds to samples
normalize - Normalizes wavefiles, so that the overall peak is 1
oct2f - Calculates frequencies from octaves
pink - Generates pink noise
place2f - Converts a basilar membrane place (mm) to a frequency (Hz)
ramps - Applies ramps to the onsets and/or offsets of a signal
rir - Generates room impulse responses
rms - Computes the root-mean-square of a signal
samp2ms - Converts samples to milliseconds
sinegen - Generates pure tones
smooth - Smooths a signal using windowing
specgram - Plots a nice spectrogram
specplot - Plots magnitude spectra
t60 - Estimates reverberation time
vocoder - Implements an envelope vocoder
wavplay - Plays a signal using the soundcard
wavread - Reads wavefiles
wavwrite - Writes wavefiles
zeropad - Zero pads the shorter of two or more arrays

numpy, scipy
