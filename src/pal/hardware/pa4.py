"""
    pa4 - functions to control TDT pa4 attenuators using the serial port

    functions include:

    set_atten(device, atten, com='COM1')
        Sets the specified attenuation level on the specified device.
        Device 1 is the first module in the first xbus, etc. Atten is
        a float in dB, between 0 <= 99.9. com is the serial port used.

    get_atten(device, com='COM1')
        Gets the current attenuation level on the specified device.

    set_mute(device, mute=False, com='COM1')
        Sets the mute for the specified device. mute is a bool.

    find_pa4(com='COM1')
        Scans the first 32 device IDs, looking for PA4s.

    To access pa4's via the serial port, set both jumpers on the back
    of the OI1 to the RIGHT.

    These functions are based on C code from the House Ear Institute,
    provided by John Wygonski.

    Tested on windows and linux.

    depends on pyserial
