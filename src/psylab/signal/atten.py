def atten(data, dB):
    '''Attenuates input array by a dB value
    
        Positive dB values yield decreases in level, negative values 
        increase level.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        data : ndarray
            Array containing numbers to attenuate. 
        dB : int
            The amount of attenuation, in dB. The default is to compute
            the mean of the flattened array.
        
        Returns
        -------
        data : array
            The input array, attenuated.
