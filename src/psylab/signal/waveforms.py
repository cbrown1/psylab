def mls(n, rand_seed=False):
    '''Generates maximum-length sequences

        Implements a Galois-configuration linear feedback shift register
        to generate maximum-length sequences, which are pseudorandom noises
        useful for acoustic measurements.

        Maximum-length sequences are nice because they have a flat frequency
        spectrum, but are comprised of only 1's and -1's. Gaussian noise,
        on the other hand, does have a flat spectrum, but is normally
        distributed around zero, meaning many of the instantaneous values are
        close to zero. So, if both noises are normalized to +/-1, the MLS is
        louder. This is advantageous when, e.g., estimating reverberation
        times, because you usually want the loudest noise you can get, since
        your likely going to have to extrapolate down to -60 dB (RT60) anyway.

        When using for reverb measurements, you want the noise to be at least
        as long as your reverb time is, so that you reach a steady-state by
        the time the noise turns off.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : scalar
            The number of starting bits.
        rand_seed : bool
            True to begin with a sequence of all ones (repeatable).
            False to begin with a random sequence.

        Returns
        -------
        y : array
            The maximum-length sequence, which is 2^(n-1) in length.

        Notes
        -----
        Careful! Longer bit lengths will take a very long time to process!

            frequency of an arbitrary (but nonetheless pure) waveform. In this
            case, dur will be ignored, and the output array will be the same
            length (the same number of samples) as input f.
        fs: scalar

        dur : scalar
            The duration in ms.
