    '''Plots magnitude spectra
        
        Plots a magnitude spectrum of the waveform. You can overlay 
        several spectra on top of one another, and specify different
        plot properties.
        
       Parameters
       ----------
       signal : array
          The input signal.
       fs : scalar
          The sampling frequency
       plotspec : string
          A matlab (matplotlib) style string specifying the plot 
          properties (eg., 'b-')
       log : bool
          Specfies wheter the x-axis is log or linear
       fighandle : Int
          A matplotlib figure handle to plot to
