def t60(data, fs, toplot=False):
    '''Estimates reverberation time
        
        Generates an integrated impulse decay curve, and uses it to estimate
        reverberation time as T60, or the time it takes for the reverberant 
        energy to decay by 60 dB.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        data : ndarray
            The input array. Pass only the segment of the IR after the offset 
            of the impulse
        fs : scalar
            The sampling frequency
        toplot : bool
            True to return slope and y-intercept values (useful if you plan 
            to plot the iidc along with a line for visual inspection)
        
        Returns
        -------
        t : scalar
            The estimated T60 (reverberation time), in ms
        y : array
            The iidc
        slope : scalar [optional]
            The slope of the line used to estimate T60
        intercept : scalar [optional]
            The y-intercept of the line used to estimate T60

        Example
        -------
        rt,iidc = t60(signal,fs)
        rt,iidc,slope,intercept = t60(signal,fs,True)
        xtime = numpy.linspace(0,float(len(iidc))/fs,len(iidc))
