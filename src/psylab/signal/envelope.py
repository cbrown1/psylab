        If use_hilbert is False, half-wave rectification and low-pass 
        filtering is used (default cutoff frequency is 16 Hz, default 
        filter order is 6. If usehilbert is True, the Hilbert transform
        is used.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        signal : array
            The signal to extract the amplitude envelope from. 
        fs : scalar
            The sampling frequency.
        use_hilbert : bool
            True to use hilbert method [env_cutoff and env_order are ignored]
            False to use half-wave rectification and low-pass filtering
        env_cutoff : scalar
            The envelope cutoff frequency [default=16 Hz].
        env_order : scalar
            The order of the envelope filter [must be even number; default=6].
        
        Returns
        -------
        env : array
            The amplitude envelope of the input signal.
