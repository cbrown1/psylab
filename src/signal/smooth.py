def smooth(x, wsize=10, wtype='hanning'):
    '''Smooths a signal using windowing
        
       Smooths the input signal using a window with specified size and type.

       This method is based on the convolution of a scaled window with the signal.
       The signal is prepared by introducing reflected copies of the signal 
       (with the window size) in both ends so that transient parts are minimized
       in the begining and end part of the output signal.
    
       Parameters
       ----------
       x : array
          The input signal.
       wsize : scalar
          The width of the smoothing window
       wtype : string
          The type of window:
            'flat' [Unweighted moving average]
            'hanning'
            'hamming'
            'bartlett'
            'blackman'
        
        Returns
        -------
        y : array
            The smoothed signal.
        
        Notes
        -----
       example:

       t=linspace(-2,2,0.1)
       x=sin(t)+randn(len(t))*0.1
       y=smooth(x)
