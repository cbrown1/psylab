def normalize(indir, reloutdir="norm", ext='wav'):
    '''Normalizes wavefiles, so that the overall peak is 1
      
        Batch process all wavefiles in a directory (or a 
        list of directories). A single peak value is found
        and all files are normalized using that. Only tested 
        with 1-channel soundfiles.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        indir : string, or list of strings
            Directories to process. 
        reloutdir : string
            The subdirectory name to save processing files to.
            This should be relative. It will be appended to indir
        ext : string
            File extension masks, comma separated
        
        Returns
        -------
        ret : tuple
            ret[0] is the peak value, ret[1] is the last filename 
            where the peak occurred.
        
        Notes
        -----
