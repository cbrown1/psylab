tdt2 - Control Tucker Davis Technologies System 2 hardware from the serial port

Modules include:

wg1 - functions to control TDT WG1 waveform generators
pa4 - functions to control TDT PA4 programmable attenuators

Notes
-----
To access TDT modules via the serial port, set both jumpers on
the back of the OI1 to the RIGHT (can be accessed from the front
of the XBUS rack). Jumpers to the left for AP2 control.

You must specify the serial port address like: 

tdt2.port = '/dev/ttyS0'

You can use tdt2.scan_ports() to return a list of available ports

Tested on windows and linux.

Dependencies
------------
