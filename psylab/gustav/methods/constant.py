"""Method of constant stimuli for Gustav

    This method has three properties, which should be set in pre_exp:
    
    exp.var.constant = {
        'trialsperblock' : 10,
        'startblock' : 1,
        'starttrial' : 1,
        }

    trialsperblock sets the number of trials to run for each block, or 
        combination of experimental variable levels.
        
    startblock and starttrial are intended for crash recovery, 
"""
