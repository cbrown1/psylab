        Pandas is great, but doesn't do a good job with headers. This function 
        skips blank and comment lines in a csv properly, and passes back a 
        file-like object ready to be passed to pandas.read_csv.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : string
            The path to the csv file.
        comment : string
            A comment character to look for. Lines that start with this 
            character will be skipped. 

        Returns
        -------
        StringIO object
            A file-like object, suitable to be passed to pandas.read_csv.
            
        Usage
        -----
        f = read_csv(filename)
        data = pandas.read_csv(f, **kwargs)
