        This is the unvectorized, lame version which might have some 
        value as it may be easier to see what's going on.         
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        f :  scalar
            fundamental frequency
        fs : scalar
            sampling frequency
        
        Kwargs
        ------
        dur : scalar
            duration in ms
        amp : scalar
            amplitude values less than or equal to 0 are treated as dB (re: 
            +-1), and values greater than 0 are used to scale the waveform 
            peak linearly. default is 1
        ncomponents : scalar
            number of harmonic components
        offset : scalar
            offset in Hz. Eg., offset = 2 would yield 202, 302, 402, etc.
          
        Returns
        -------
        y : array
            The waveform
