frequency.py - A collection of functions for various frequency conversions. 

Functions include:

f2oct - Calculates octaves from frequencies
oct2f - Calculates frequencies from octaves
f2erbs - Converts frequency values to erb numbers
erbs2f - Converts erb numbers to frequency values
f2place - Converts a frequency (Hz) to a basilar membrane place (mm)
place2f - Converts a basilar membrane place (mm) to a frequency (Hz)

Dependencies:

numpy

def oct2f(cf, oct):
    '''Calculates frequencies from octaves
        
        Returns a tuple containing the upper and lower frequencies that 
        are the specified number of octaves away from the center frequency
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        cf : scalar
            A center frequency. 
        oct : scalar
            The distance, in octaves, to be computed.
        
        Returns
        -------
        lo : scalar
            The frequency that is oct octaves below cf.
        hi : scalar
            The frequency that is oct octaves above cf.

def f2erbs(f):
    '''Converts frequency values to erb numbers

        converts an array of frequencies (in Hz) to the corresponding 
        values on the ERB-rate scale on which the human ear has 
        roughly constant resolution as judged by psychophysical 
        measurements of the cochlear filters.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        f : scalar or array
            Frequencies, in Hz.

def erbs2f(erbs):
    '''Converts erb numbers to frequency values

        converts a vector of ERB-rate values
        to the corresponding frequencies in Hz.

        Note that erb values must not exceed 42.79

        Parameters
        ----------
