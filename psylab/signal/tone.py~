def tone(f, fs, dur, **kwargs):
    '''Generates pure tones

        Parameters
        ----------
        f: scalar/array
            Frequency info. If f is a scalar, then a pure tone of fixed
            frequency is created. If f is a 2-element array, the values will be
            the start and end frequecies of a linear frequency sweep. If f is
            an array of length > 2, the values will be the instantaneous
            frequency of an arbitrary (but nonetheless pure) waveform. In this
            case, dur will be ignored, and the output array will be the same
            length (the same number of samples) as input f.
        fs: scalar
            The sampling frequency.
        dur : scalar
            The duration in ms.

        Kwargs
        ------
        amp : scalar/array
            Amplitude values less than or equal to 0 are treated as dB (re:
             +-1), and values greater than 0 are used to scale the waveform
             peak linearly. default is 1
        phase : scalar
            The starting phase in degrees. default is 0

        Returns
        -------
        y : array
            The specified signal.

        Notes
        -----
        Examples:

        # Generate a 1000-Hz pure tone, with a sample rate of 22050, a
        # duration of 1s, an amplitude of +-.9, and a cosine starting phase
        t = tone(1000, 44100, 1000, amp=.9, phase=180);

        # Generate a tone with an amplitude that is 3 dB down from peak (+-1.0)
        t = tone(1000, 44100, 1000, amp=-3);

        # Generate a linear tone sweep starting at 200 Hz and ending at 750 Hz
        t = tone((200, 750), 44100, 1000, amp=-3);

        # Generate 2-Hz FM (with 50 Hz mod depth), on a 500-Hz carrier
        fm = tone(tone(2, 44100, 1000) * 25 + 500, 44100);
