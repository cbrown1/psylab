def convolve(x, h):
    '''Convolves two signals using FFT-based fast convolution
        
        If either x or h is 2-d, each column is treated as a channel, 
        and convolution is applied to each. In this case, h can be 1-d, 
        in which case the same h is convolved with each channel of x, or 
        it can be 2-d and have the same number of columns (channels) as x. 
        Alternately, x can be 1-d and h can be 2-d, and you get the idea...

        Parameters
        ----------
        x: array
            First array. Can be 1- or 2-d
        h: array
            Second array. Can be 1- or 2-d

        Returns
        -------
        y : array
            x convolved with h.
