             air, and at sea level.

        ir_ref_mag : float
            A reference magnitude, used for scaling the ir. Default is 1, which 
            means no scaling. But if you are using the associated gen_sweep 
            function, one option is to use the peak magnitude of the 'ideal' 
            ir, which can be obtained by passing to this function the sweep as 
            the recording:
                
                >>> sweep,inv_filter = gen_sweep()

            For default parameters (as written above), this reference magnitude 
            is 18677.3.
            
            I am not sure if this is the best way to scale the ir, but the 
            advantages are that (1) it leads to reasonable ir magnitudes for 
            actual recorded signals, (2) it ensures that 0 >= ir >= 1, and (3) 
            it preserves magnitude differences across recordings.
