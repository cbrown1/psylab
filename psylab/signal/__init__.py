signal - A collection of functions for psychoacoustics-based signal processing.
Some are pedagogical in nature, others might actually be useful.

Functions include:

atten - Attenuates input array by a dB value
compensate - Shapes the input array in the frequency domain
compress - Applies simple, single-channel compression to input signal signal
envelope - Extracts the amplitude envelope from a signal
equate - Equates wavefiles in rms
erbs2f - Converts erb numbers to frequency values
f0 - Estimates the fundamental frequency of a signal
f2erbs - Converts frequency values to erb numbers
f2place - Converts a frequency (Hz) to a basilar membrane place (mm)
f2oct - Calculates the distance in octaves between two frequencies
fconv - Convolves two signals using FFT-based fast convolution
filter_bank - Filters the input array with a bank of filters
freq_compress - Performs frequency compression on a signal
freqs_logspace - Computes a range of frequencies evenly spaced in log space
gso - Varies the inter-aural correlation of a stereo signal
hrtf_data - Helper class for handling hrtf data
ild - Applies an interaural level difference to a signal
interp - Interpolates a signal to a specified number of points
itd - Applies an interaural time difference to a signal
lts - Computes a long-term spectrum of a signal
magspec - Computes the magnitude spectrum of a signal
mix - Mixes [adds] signals, zero padding as needed and at specified offsets
mls - Generates maximum-length sequences
ms2samp - Converts milliseconds to samples
normalize - Normalizes wavefiles, so that the overall peak is 1
oct2f - Calculates frequencies from octaves
pick_peaks - Finds rms peaks in signals
pink - Generates pink noise
place2f - Converts a basilar membrane place (mm) to a frequency (Hz)
pre_emphasis - Applies a pre-emphasis filter to a signal
ramps - Applies ramps to the onsets and/or offsets of a signal
rir - Generates room impulse responses
rms - Computes the root-mean-square of a signal
samp2ms - Converts samples to milliseconds
sliding_window - Apply a sliding window to a signal for vectorized processing
smooth - Smooths a signal using windowing
specgram - Plots a nice spectrogram
specplot - Plots magnitude spectra
t60 - Estimates reverberation time
tone - Generates pure tones
tcomplex - Generates tone complexes
vocoder - Implements an envelope vocoder
white - Generates white noise
win_attack - Generates windows with control over attack times
zeropad - Zero pads the shorter of two or more arrays
