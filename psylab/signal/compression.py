def compress(sig, fs, threshold, comp_ratio, attack, release, ref_spl=110, delay_audio=False, make_up=False, return_gain_function=False):
    """Applies simple, single-channel compression to input signal sig in the
        time domain. Optionally returns the gain control signal in addition to
        the compressed signal.   
        
        The gain control signal is determined using a peak detector algorithm
        (cf Kates 2008, p233). Note that the peak detector operates on the
        instantaneous full-wave rectified input signal.
        
        Absolute levels are in reference to the measured SPL of a cal tone, 
        played at full volume (+- 1 v) on your system. 
        
        Attack and release time are specified in milliseconds and correspond to
        the 1/e time constants of the peak detector. Note that the observed
        attack and release time of the compressor system (measured in
        accordance with ANSI S3.22 / IEC 60118-2) will be different, as these 
        depend on other factors (compression ratio, threshold, amount of
        overshoot, etc) in a complicated way - cf Kates 1995. 
        
        The compression rule is linear amplification below threshold,
        compressive amplification (in accordance with compression ratio) above
        threshold. Note that there is no constraint on negative gain (ie
        attenuation) occurring at high input levels.
        
        If delay_audio is true, the audio signal is delayed by half the
        attack time. This reduces the amount of overshoot seen when the input
        level increases abruptly (cf Stone & Moore 2004). Warning: if the input
        signal does not contain enough trailing silence to accommodate the
        delay, the end of the signal will be truncated! (Note also that this
        delay length may not be optimal and may introduce other side-effects,
        eg "preshoot".) 
        
        If the make_up option is true, make-up gain is applied automatically
        such that the overall rms level of the compressed signal is equal to
        that of the input signal.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        sig : array
            The input signal to be compressed (mono)
        fs : scalar
            The sampling frequency
        threshold : scalar
            The compression threshold (ie lower kneepoint) in dB SPL
        comp_ratio : scalar
            The compression ratio (eg a value of 2 gives 2:1 compression
            above the compression threshold)
        attack : scalar
            The attack time constant in ms (see note above)
        release :
            The release time constant in ms (see note above)
        ref_spl : scalar
            The measured SPL, in dB, of a tone at 1 v peak-to-peak. This is 
            used as the reference for compression threshold
        delay_audio : bool
            if true, audio signal is delayed by half the
            attack time [default = False]
        make_up : bool
            If true, make-up gain is applied [default = False]
        return_gain_function : bool
            If True, the returned array is the gain control signal
            If False, the returned array is the input signal with gc applied [default]
        
        Returns
        -------
        y : array
            Either the compressed output signal or the sample-by-sample gain 
            (in dB) applied by the compressor (Note: the effect of the 
            delay_audio option is not accounted for in the returned gain control 
            signal)
