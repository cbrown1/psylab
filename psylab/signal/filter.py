def pre_emphasis(signal, fs, hp=50):
    """Applies a pre-emphasis filter to a signal

        Applies a 6 dB per octave highpass filter to the specified signal.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signal : 1-d array
            The input signal
        fs : scalar
            The sampling frequency
        hp : scalar
            The high-pass cutoff frequency to use [default = 50 Hz]

        Notes
        -----
        The formula for alpha was taken from PRAAT.

def filter_bank(signal, fs, order, cfs, btype='band'):
    """Filters the input array with a bank of filters

        Filters a signal with the cutoff frequencies specified in cfs.

        Note: The returned array will be 2-d with one fewer column (dim=1)
        than len(cfs). cfs[:-1] will be used as highpass cutoff frequencies,
        and cfs[1:] will be used as lowpass cutoff frequencies.

        The signal can either be 1-d, or 2-d where shape[1]==len(cfs)-1
        (ie., it can already have been filter_banked; eg., bandpass
        filtering followed by envelope extraction, which is the usecase
        that this function was written for).

        Parameters
        ----------
        signal : 1- or 2-d array
            The input signal
        fs : scalar
            The sampling frequency
        order : scalar
            The filter order to use
        cfs : array
            An array of cutoff frequencies
        btype : str
            The type of filter to implement ['band','low','high']

        Returns
        -------
        y : 2-d array
            The filtered signal, with the output of each filter along dim 1

        The output of this function is useful as the cfs input to filter_bank,
        when you want to create a bank of bandpass filters.

        Parameters
        ----------
        start : scalar
            The start frequency, in Hz
        stop : scalar
            The end frequency, in Hz
        n : scalar
            The number of 'channels' to compute. That is, the return array
