    '''Equates wavefiles in rms
        
        Batch process all wavefiles in a directory (or a 
        list of directories). The lowest rms value is found
        and all files are scaled to that. Only tested with 
        1-channel soundfiles.
      
        Parameters
        ----------
        indir : string, or list of strings
            Directories to process. 
        reloutdir : string
            The subdirectory name to save processing files to.
            This should be relative. It will be appended to indir
        ext : string
            File extension masks, comma separated
        
        Returns
        -------
        ret : tuple
            ret[0] is the lowest rms value, ret[1] is the last 
            filename where that value occurred.
