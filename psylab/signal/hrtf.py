def convolve(x, h):
    '''Convolves two signals using FFT-based fast convolution
        
        If either x or h is 2-d, each column is treated as a channel, 
        and convolution is applied to each. In this case, h can be 1-d, 
        in which case the same h is convolved with each channel of x, or 
        it can be 2-d and have the same number of columns (channels) as x. 
        Alternately, x can be 1-d and h can be 2-d, and you get the idea...

        Parameters
        ----------
        x: array
            First array. Can be 1- or 2-d
        h: array
            Second array. Can be 1- or 2-d

        Returns
        -------
        y : array
            x convolved with h.
            
        Notes
        -----
        This is slower than np.convolve. My performance test (using 3s of 
        audio @ 44.1k) shows it is about half the speed of np.convolve with 
        1-d arrays, and the speed difference decreases as the number of 
        channels increases (performance was about .75 that of np.convolve when 
        x had 32-channels).

        Notes
        -----
        Assumes datafile is a 2-dimensional numpy array saved with np.save, with 
        the coefficients along dim 1 and each available azimuth along dim 2. 
        
        Further assumes that the azimuths are evenly distributed in a full 
        circle, starting with 0 degrees (ie., if there are four azimuths, they 
        are assumed to be 0, 90, 180, and 270). Thus, all data in a datafile 
        should be for a single elevation.
