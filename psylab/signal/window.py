def win_attack(ws, rs, ramp_fun=np.bartlett):
    """generates a window of length ws that is ramped (ramp
        length of rs) from 0 to 1, where 0 is ommitted. ramp_fun
        is the name of the windowing function to use to specify
        the shape of ramp (can be np.hanning, np.bartlett, etc).

        If rs is shorter than ws, then the rest of the window
        will be ones. If rs is longer than ws, then the value
        of the last element will be less than one. Eg., if
        ws is half of rs, the window will be length ws, and
        the last element will be .5.

             att    wsize

        Parameters
        ----------
        ws : int
            window size in samples
        rs : int
            ramp size in samples
        ramp_fun : function
            The windowing function to use to shape the ramp.
            default is np.bartlett, which yeilds a linear ramp.

        Returns
        -------
        win : array
            The window

        Examples
        --------
        >>> win_attack(5, 2)
        [0.5 1.  1.  1.  1. ]

        >>> win_attack(5, 10)
        [0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5]

        Notes
        -----
        Handles gracefully cases where the ramp is longer than the win
        (ie., long attack time constants), which is the particular
        usecase this was written for.

        Also note that 0 (starting amp) does not appear in the win.
        Rather, the first value in the window will be the first
        interpolated amplitude between 0 and 1 given rs. This allows
        this function to be easily used along with sliding_window to
        allow amplitude changes over time with smooth transitions
        from one window to the next (consider rs the time constant
        of the amplitude change). Ie., to smoothly change amplitudes
        over time, use sliding window to window your data, then for
        each window, set amp_prev to be the ending amp from the
        previous window, and amp_cur to be the target amp for the
        current window. Then simply compute:

            # this_win is a window of data from sliding_window
            # attwin is the output of this function
            this_win *= (attwin * (amp_cur-amp_prev))+amp_prev

    """
    win = np.ones(ws)
    ramp = ramp_fun((rs*2)+1)[:rs+1]
    rs_clipped = np.minimum(rs, ws)
    win[:rs_clipped] = ramp[1:rs_clipped+1]
    return win


def sliding_window(sig, ws, ss = None, flatten = True):
    '''Return a sliding window over an array in any number of dimensions

        Parameters
        ----------
        sig : array
            The n-dimensional input signal
        ws : int or tuple
            an int (a is 1D) or tuple (a is 2D or greater) representing the
            size of each dimension of the window
        ss : int or tuple
            an int (a is 1D) or tuple (a is 2D or greater) representing the
            amount to slide the window in each dimension. If not specified, it
            defaults to ws.
        flatten : bool
            if True, all slices are flattened, otherwise, there is an extra
            dimension for each dimension of the input.

        Returns
        -------
        y : array
            an array containing each n-dimensional window from a

        Edits include:
          * Removed dependency to custom function norm_shape, which no longer
            appears necessary with modern numpy versions
          * Renamed some variables for clarity
          * Improved docstrings
          * Other minor cleanup
