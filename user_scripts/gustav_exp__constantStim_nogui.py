    """STIMULUS SETS
        If you generate all your stimuli on the fly, you don't need any of these.

        The only required property is `type`, which should be either `manual`
        or `files`. If it is 'files', the function stim.get_next will be called 
        prior to each trial, and you can access the current token at 
        stim.current[setname]. In this case, you must also set the `path` 
        variable. If type is manual, nothing will occur automatically. `manual`
        stim sets are useful if you have a level of an experimental variable 
        that is stimulus-based, and another level of that variable that is 
        not. For example, you might want a masker variable to be both a talker
        (files on disk, type='files') and speech-shaped noise which you generate
        digitally as needed (type='manual').  
        
        If `type` is set to `files`, an additional setting is required:

        `path` is the full path to the folder containing the files

        There are several optional settings when `type` is `files`:

        `text` is the full path to a text file containing info on each token.
                There should be one line per token, and the format can be
                specified (see below).

        `txtfmt` If you're using a text file, specify the format here.
                The comma-delimited values you list here will be used as keys
                to the info dictionary in stim.current to allow you to retrieve
                the info. For example, if you set txtfmt to be `file,kw,text`,
                and your file looks like `CUNY001,4,They LOOKED UP at the BLUE SKY.`, 
                then you can use stim.current[stimname].info['kw'] to get the value 
                4, and stim.current[stimname].info['text'] will be `They LOOKED...`.
                One txtfmt value needs to be 'file', and the corresponding text in
                the textfile should be the filename (without the extension), as that
                is how the info is connected to a token.

        `mask` is a list of filemasks (e.g., '*.wav; *.WAV'). default = '*.*'

        `process` is either `manual` or `auto`. default = `auto`. When its `auto`,
                the function stim.get_next will be called once before the start of 
                every trial, which simply loads information for the next stimulus
                token in the list into stim.current[stimname] (useful if you need 
                exactly 1 stim token per trial). If `manual`, stim.get_next will 
                not be called, and you will have to call it yourself as needed
                (useful if you need something other than exactly 1 stim token per
                trial). 

        `order` is the presentation order: `random`, `natural`, or a print
                range style string, which should be a comma-separated list of
                values, which can be either a single number, or a colon-delimited
                range. Make the first item in the list the string `random` to
                randomize the list. default is `natural`

        `repeat` is whether to run through the list again if we run out. If this
                is True and `order` is random, a new random order will be
                generated each time. If this is false, you must ensure that there
                are enough stimulus files available. default is False

    """EXPERIMENT VARIABLES
        There are 2 kinds of variables: factorial and covariable

        Levels added as 'factorial' variables will be factorialized with each
        other. So, if you have 2 fact variables A & B, each with 3 levels, you
        will end up with 9 conditions: A1B1, A1B2, A1B3, A2B1 etc..

        Levels added as 'covariable' variables will simply be listed (in parallel
        with the corresponding levels from the other variables) in the order
        specified. So, if you have 2 'covariable' variables A & B, each with 3
        levels, you will end up with 3 conditions: A1B1, A2B2, and A3B3. All
        'covariable' variables must have either the same number of levels, or
        exactly one level. When only one level is specified, that level will
        be used in all 'covariable' conditions. Eg., A1B1, A2B1, A3B1, etc.

        You can use both types of variables in the same experiment, but both
        factorial and covariable must contain exactly the same set of variable
        names. factorial levels are processed first, covariable levels are added
        at the end (and then the entire list gets randomized, etc).

        Each variable (whether factorial or covariable) should have 3 properties:

        'name' is the name of the variable, as a string

        'type' is either 'manual' or 'stim'. 'manual' variables are ones that
                the experimenter will handle in the stimgen. 'stim' variables
                are ones that will load stimulus files. One usecase would be
                eg., if you preprocess your stimuli and want to read the same
                files, but from different directories depending on the
                treatment.

        'levels' should be a list of strings that identify each level of interest
