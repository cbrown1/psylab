    Parameters:
    -----------
    data : numpy.ndarray
        Representation of the experimental data.

    comparisons : list or tuple
        A list of pairs of the form `(ii,jj)`, where `ii` and `jj` are lists

        The correction function to control the family-wise error rate.
        The default value is bonferroni.

        String of human-readable factor names.
