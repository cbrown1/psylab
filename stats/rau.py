def rau( p ):
    '''Converts percent correct scores into "rationalized" arcsine units
        
        The arcsine transform normalizes percent-correct data. The 
        "Rationalized" nature of the transform simply means that the 
        resulting values are roughly similar to PC data for a large 
        range of the distribution (~ .15 < .85). This transform is 
        appropriate if you have data falling outside of this range 
        (data falling within this range won'tbe appreciably affected). 
        Rau values are between -.23 (PC=0) and 1.23 (PC=100). 
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        p : scalar or array
            Should be percent correct values, 0 < 1
        
        Returns
        -------
        r : scalar or array
            Converted rau values
